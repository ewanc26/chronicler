## Features

- **Economy Tracking** — Detects Vault at runtime, records transactions in newspaper
- **Breaking News** — Special coverage when players first enter The End
- **Dynamic Newspaper** — Generates a structured book with sections: Headlines, Breaking News, Obituaries, Achievements, Hunting Grounds, Exploration & Building, Economy & Trading, Social, Statistics
- **LLM Integration** — Optional AI-powered article generation via Ollama, OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenRouter, OpenAI), or Anthropic Claude; falls back to template summaries
- **Web View** — Optional embedded HTTP server serves a styled HTML version of each issue with dark/light theme toggle and RSS feed
- **Editorial Workflow** — Create, preview, edit, remove stories from, and approve persistent draft issues
- **Newspaper Layout** — Ranked articles with configurable bylines, tone, section order, colours, and clean continuation pages
- **Privacy Controls** — Exclude players and redact private messages, chat excerpts, and coordinates
- **Archive & Search** — Retention policies, import/export, web issue navigation, permalinks, and full-text search
- **Safe Updates** — Automatic GitHub release updates with mandatory SHA-256 verification
- **PlaceholderAPI** — 13+ placeholders exposing issue stats, player playtime, login streaks
- **Archived Issues** — Every issue is saved to disk and browsable via `/chronicler archive`
- **Headline Ticker** — Periodic action-bar broadcasts of random headlines from the latest issue
- **Issue #0** — On first run, server logs (`logs/latest.log` and rotated `*.log.gz`) are parsed to backfill historical events (joins, deaths, advancements, chat) into issue #0
- **Auto-Delivery** — Each new issue spawns directly into every online player's inventory (drops at feet if full); players can opt out with `/chronicler subscribe`
- **Locale Support** — All messages customizable via `messages.yml` (MiniMessage format)
- **bStats Metrics** — Anonymous usage statistics (configurable)
- **Paper Plugin Support** — Includes `paper-plugin.yml` with soft dependency declarations for PlaceholderAPI and Vault
